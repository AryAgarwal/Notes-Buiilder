# Notes-Buiilder
It is a mini-project that uses Generative AI.
First using the Whisper API, I convert speech to text using the Transcribe function. If the audio is not in English then the Translate function can be used.
Secondly, using openAI API, the chatgpt model is created. A prompt is sent that asks the model to convert the audio into notes with bullet points and a summary.
